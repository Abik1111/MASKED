# MASKED
The project above consists of three main parts:\
1> The jupyter notebook that was use to train the model for seperating the masked and unmasked faces.\
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link to the data set is as follows:\

2> Secondly the face detector model that is built inside the OpenCV. The deploy.protoxt.txt and the \
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel file are used to access the DNN model to detect faces.\
3> Finally everything is put together in the python file facevideo.py which detects, predicts and\
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faces without mask\
